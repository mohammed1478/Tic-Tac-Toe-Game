### What I learned:
1.  use of  the legacy tool "grid layout" on android studio
2.  adding images to the grid layout
3.  removing source from images to make it appear invisible
4.  using a single onClick method for multiple images by utilizing the "view"  variable
5.  using tags on each image to keep track of the images.
6.  using arrays to hold data that determines who wins and continuously comparing to see if a player has won yet. 
7.  resetting the app everytime user wants to play again.
8.  using animations in app.
